# 📘 Basic Data Structure

Welcome to the **Basic-Data-Structure** repository 🚀

This repository is a structured collection of **fundamental Data Structure concepts implemented in C++**. It is designed mainly for **beginners** who want to build a strong foundation in Data Structures through hands-on coding and clear logic.

This repo focuses on understanding **how things work internally**, not just memorizing solutions.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

* Build a **strong base in Data Structures**
* Practice **C++ syntax with real use-cases**
* Improve **problem-solving and logical thinking**
* Prepare for **DSA, competitive programming, and interviews**
* Keep all learning materials **organized and revision-friendly**

This repository reflects continuous learning — code quality improves as concepts become clearer.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

Currently, this repository includes implementations and practice related to:

* Arrays
* Singly Linked List
* Doubly Linked List
* Stack
* Queue
* Basic problem-solving with Data Structures

⚠️ *Tree and Graph are not included yet. They will be added later once fundamentals are fully solid.*

## 🚀 How to Run the Code

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Tauhidrana/Basic-Data-Structure.git
```

2. Go to any module folder:

```bash
cd Basic-Data-Structure/Module-3
```

3. Compile the C++ file:

```bash
g++ file.cpp -o file
```

4. Run the program:

```bash
./file
```

Modify the code, break it, fix it again — that’s how real learning happens.

## 🧠 Learning Philosophy

This repository follows a **slow but deep** approach:

* Understand logic before optimization
* Write code by hand, not copy-paste
* Learn why something fails, not just why it works

Data Structures are not magic — they are disciplined thinking in code form.

---

## 📌 Notes

* Code may not always be optimized — clarity is the priority
* Naming and structure improve over time
* This is a **learning repository**, not a finished product

## 🤝 Contribution

This is mainly a personal learning repo. However:

* Suggestions are welcome
* Better approaches are appreciated
* Constructive feedback is always valuable
